3D scanning based estimating the center of gravity of the body

Hardware requirements: 3 kinect azures, 3 vive trackers, HTC vive, GPU

1. attach a tracker on every kinect camera, obtain initial pose by multiple sampling
2. select a fixed area by using VR controller immersively, e.g. one person needs a 2*2*2 = 8 cubic meters
3. generate depth map and map depth to point
4. reconstruct surface by using fusion method/ online surface reconstruction(use compute shader), low-poly mesh is also sufficient.
5. remove outliers while reconstructing
6. estimate center of gravity by using the mesh

optional task:

1. recosntruct dense mesh
2. draw the trajectory of the center of gravity
3. evaluate the center of gravity
